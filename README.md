# [Lung Cancer Model Comparison using R (Logit and Probit Model Comparison)](https://github.com/oderinde300/Lung-cancer)
This contains the code and dataset used for my publication on the topic ["Estimating the Likelihood of Cancer Occurrence Based on Patient Data and Lifestyle Factors: A Comparison between Logit and Probit Regression"](https://www.oalib.com/paper/6831526). The data used was obtained from the Kaggle website. Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of occurrence of lung cancer based on patient data and lifestyle factors. Several diagnostics were performed to know if the model fits the data well.
# [Analysis on the Prevalence of Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis](https://github.com/oderinde300/Asthma-prevalence).
This contains the code and dataset used for my publication on the topic ["Statistical Analysis of The Prevalence of Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis in Nigeria"](https://abjournals.org/ajste/papers/volume-4/issue-4/statistical-analysis-on-the-prevalence-and-predictors-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis-in-nigeria/).
