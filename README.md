# [Lung Cancer Model Comparison using R (Logit and Probit Model Comparison)](https://github.com/oderinde300/Lung-cancer)
This contain the code and dataset used for my publication on the topic ["Estimating the Likelihood of Cancer Occurrence Based on Patient Data and Lifestyle Factors: A Comparison between Logit and Probit Regression"](https://www.oalib.com/paper/6831526). The data used was obtained from kaggle website. Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of occurrence of lung cancer based on patient data and lifestyle factors. Several diagnostics was performed to know if the model fits the data well.
